# Meeting Minutes

## Notes for 2/5

Gayane Vardoyan

## Notes for 1/7

ACTION ITEM: Please go over the files "assigned" to you to triage VIABLE applicants
ACTION ITEM: If someone can figure out how to SEARCH-BY-FLAG let us know :)

1. I WILL bin all the current (300+) applications on APOL, and am assigning each of you
   the following FLAGs. (Some files have multiple tags, so will be looked at by multiple folks.)

2. Recall that our goal right now is to just identify ~ 60 files that we can then look
   at in greater detail. Once I classify (or you can help out too :-)) please start 
   going over the files to mark off which ones are VIABLE (you can use that tag if you like) 
   I am using "SKIP" to denote "NOT VIABLE".

3. If someone can figure out how to coax the SEARCH mechanism to search by tag, let me know.
   Right now I am just adding the FLAGS to the set of columns, and then sorting by FLAGS but
   thats a bit gross.

4. Next, EACH WEEK we will go roughly by AREA, discuss the candidates in that area and hopefully 
   vote on 3-4 to invite.

### Focus Areas

Areas (primary â€“ at least 2 interviews, if strong candidates found)
  - Quantum Computing Systems (if find 2)
  - AI (incl. Reinforcement Learning and Trustworthy AI)
  - HCI (with possible focus on increased access to disadvantaged/disabled) 
  - Security

Secondary Focus Areas (if we see a strong candidate, we will interview them)
  - Algorithms
  - SW Engineering

Tertiary Focus Areas
  - All others

### Area Leads

[Kamalika]
* AI
++ THY

[David]
* GFX
* ROB
++ VIS
++ DATA

[Stefan]
* SEC 
* SYS
* DB

[Ranjit]
++ CPS, EMB, DAC, ARCH
* QC
* OTHER 

[Nadia]
* PL
* SWENGG
* HCI


### Interviews 

We have 3-5 slots ~~ 16 interviews.

### Rubric

* Discuss BEFORE ranking ... ranking "hardens" positions/pros/cons
* Only CLARIFICATIONs during talk, hold questions to the END
* ALL comments read out & faculty who filled rubric speak FIRST
* Rubrics serve to STRUCTURE the conversation

PUBS    : SKIP/VIABLE
AWARDS  : STAR (many fellowships etc, IEEE MICRO)
LETTERS : STAR
IMPACT  : STAR
C2D     : SKIP/VIABLE

PUBS    : STAR? (5x FOCS, 5x VLDB, 4x ICDE, 3x SODA, 2x NIPS)
AWARDS  : VIABLE/STAR (CAREER, Google research, FOCS 16 'highlighted', HALG plenary talk. VLDB best paper, ICDE 12 finalist)
LETTERS : VIABLE/STAR ... not ultra effusive, e.g. junior candidates letters were stronger?
IMPACT  : STAR (HALG etc. several important open problems)
C2D     : STAR (long, strong statement, various efforts, but of course, senior.)

### Stefan's notes on Excellence Slots

- Must have demonstrated ACTION (not merely INTENT)
- Must have demonstrated AGENCY (vs e.g. advising URM student by chance)
