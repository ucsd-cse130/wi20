- **Homework Assignments (30%)** :
  There will be 7 programming assignments,
  assigned every one or two weeks.
  Instructions on turning them in will be posted with
  each assignment.
  
    - You can work on the assignment *in groups of two*.
      [Register your group here][groups].    
      You have to submit your solution individually.
      
    - You have a total of *four late days*
      that you can use throughout the quarter as you need them,
      where a late day means anything between 1 second and 23
      hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline.

- **Midterm (30%)** :
  Will be held on **Monday February 11** during the lecture.
  The midterm is **closed book**, but you may use a
  double-sided hand-written **"cheat sheet"**.

- **Final (35%)** :
  Will be held on **Friday March 22nd, from 11:30am -- 2:30pm** in TBD.
  It **must** be taken at the scheduled time and location.
  To turn in your completed final examination, you must
  present a valid UCSD ID at the time the examination
  papers are handed to the instructor; papers not
  accompanied by a valid UCSD ID will not be accepted.
  The final is **closed book**, but you may use a
  double-sided hand-written **"cheat sheet"**.
  
    - Since the final is cumulative your midterm grade will be calculated as 
      `midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0`.
      This means that you get a second chance if you don’t do well on the midterm but 
      you must show up to both the midterm and the final.

- **Piazza (5%)** : 
  Extra credit for top-20 best participants on Piazza,
  determined by the instruction team.
