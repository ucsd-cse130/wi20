## What is CSE 130 about?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## What is CSE 130 **not** about?

Learning... 

- JavaScript in April
- Haskell in May
- C++ in June
- etc. 

### New languages come (and go ...)

There was no

- Java        25 years ago
- C#          20 years ago
- Rust        10 years ago
- WebAssembly 1 year ago


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## What is CSE 130 about?

- Concepts in programming languages
- Programming paradigms
- Language design and implementation


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## A Programming Language

### Two Variables

- `x`, `y`

### Three Operations

- `x++`
- `x--`
- `x = 0 ? L1 : L2`


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Example Program

(What _does_ it do?)

```
L1: x++
    y--
    y = 0 ? L2 : L1
L2: ...
```


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## The above language is "equivalent to" every PL!

- But good luck writing QuickSort ...
- ... or Plants v. Zombies
- ... or Spotify!

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## So Why Study Programming Languages?

![Federico Fellini](/static/img/fellini.png){#fig:fellini .align-center width=25%}

> A different language
> is
> a different vision
> of life.


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## So Why Study Programming Languages?

> The principle of **linguistic relativity**
> holds that the structure of a language
> affects its speakers world view or cognition.

Or more simply:

> Programming Language
> shapes
> Programming Thought.

Language affects how ideas and computation are expresseds

## Course Goals

![Morpheus, The Matrix](/static/img/morpheus.png){#fig:morpheus .align-center width=25%}

> Free Your Mind.



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Goal: Learn the Anatomy of PL

![Anatomy](/static/img/anatomy.png){#fig:anatomy .align-center width=20%}


- What makes a programming language?
- Which features are **fundamental** and which are **syntactic sugar**? 





<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Goal: Learn New Languages / Constructs

![Musical Score](/static/img/music-score.png){#fig:music .align-center width=30%}

New ways to **describe** and **organize** computation,
to create programs that are:

- **Correct**
- **Readable**
- **Extendable**
- **Reusable**



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>






## Goal: How to Design new Languages

New hot lanuages being designed in industry as we speak:

- Flow, React @ Facebook     
- Rust @ Mozilla, 
- TypeScript @ Microsoft
- Swift @ Apple
- WebAsssembly @ Google + Mozilla + Microsoft

Buried in every large system is a (domain-specific) language

- DB: SQL
- Word, Excel: Formulas, Macros, VBScript
- Emacs: LISP
- Latex, shell scripts, makefiles, ...

If you work on a large system, you **will** design a new PL!



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Goal: Enable You To Choose Right PL

But isn't that decided by

- Libraries
- Standards
- Hiring
- Your Boss?!

Yes.

**My goal:** Educate tomorrow's leaders so you'll make **informed** choices.



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Course Syllabus

**Functional Programming**

- Lambda calculus (2 weeks)
- Haskell (6 weeks)

**Logic Programming**

- Prolog (2 weeks)

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## **QuickSort** in C

```c
void sort(int arr[], int beg, int end){
  if (end > beg + 1){
    int piv = arr[beg];
    int l = beg + 1;
    int r = end;
    while (l != r-1)
       if(arr[l] <= piv) l++;
       else swap(&arr[l], &arr[r--]);
    if(arr[l]<=piv && arr[r]<=piv)
       l=r+1;
    else if(arr[l]<=piv && arr[r]>piv)
       {l++; r--;}
    else if (arr[l]>piv && arr[r]<=piv)
       swap(&arr[l++], &arr[r--]);
    else r=l-1;
    swap(&arr[r--], &arr[beg]);
    sort(arr, beg, r);
    sort(arr, l, end);
  }
}
```



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **QuickSort** in Haskell

```Haskell
sort []     = []
sort (x:xs) = sort ls ++ [x] ++ sort rs
  where
    ls      = [ l | l <- xs, l <= x ]
    rs      = [ r | r <- xs, x <  r ]
```

(not a wholly [fair comparison...](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717691/why-is-the-minimalist-example-haskell-quicksort-not-a-true-quicksort))

## Students with Disabilites

Students requesting accommodations for this course due to a disability or current functional limitation must provide 
a current **Authorization for Accommodation (AFA)** letter issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) 
which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall.
  
Students are required to present their AFA letters to Faculty (please make arrangements to contact me privately) and to the CSE OSD Liaison [Christina Rontell](https://cse.ucsd.edu/people/administrative-staff/christina-rontell) in advance so that accommodations may be arranged.

## Diversity and Inclusion

Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive. 
If there is a way we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know, 
either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door.
Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process, and we welcome your perspectives and input.  

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect your classmates, 
abiding by the UCSD [Principles of Community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).
Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own,
and help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels comfortable.

If you experience any sort of **harassment or discrimination**, please contact the [Office of Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/).
Students may receive confidential assistance at the [Sexual Assault Resource Center](http://care.ucsd.edu) at (858) 534-5793
or [Counseling and Psychological Services](http://caps.ucsd.edu.) (CAPS) at (858) 534-3755.

## Basic Needs

- Are you eating properly?
- Do you have adequate access to nutritious food?
- Do you have stable housing?
- Are you homeless or couch surfing?

If you or someone you know has food and/or housing insecurity, be aware of [Basic Needs](http://basicneeds.ucsd.edu)

- The [Triton Food Pantry](https://www.facebook.com/tritonfoodpantry/) (in the old Student Center), is free and anonymous, and includes produce. 
- Financial aid resources, the possibility of emergency grant funding, and off-campus housing referral resources are available.
- CAPS and college deans can connect students to the above resources, as well as other community resources and support.
