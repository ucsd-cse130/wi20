**LATE POLICY:** You have a total of **4** late days

## Sample Exam Questions

Note: 2018 exams are the most representative. 
Older exams use OCaml instead of Haskell.
Check out these [lecture notes](https://ucsd-cse130.github.io/web/lectures/02-haskell.html) 
for a comparison between the two languages.
